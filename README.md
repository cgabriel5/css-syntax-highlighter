# css-syntax-highlighter

An experimental CSS syntax highlighter.

### Live Demo

See example of highlighted CSS [here](https://cgabriel5.github.io/css-syntax-highlighter/).

### How To Use

Take a look at `js/app.js`, `js/source/test.js`, `lib/lib.js`, and `index.html` to see how it's used. Colors can be customized by editing `css/styles.css`.

### Issues

* Very longs strings can take time to parse (strings > 300,000 characters will fail in Google Chrome). 

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Found a bug, feel like documentation is lacking/confusing and needs an update, have performance/feature suggestions or simply found a typo? Let me know! :)
